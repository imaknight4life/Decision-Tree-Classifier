# Decision-Tree-Classifier
# Music Genre Prediction (Decision Tree)

## Overview
A simple machine learning project that uses a decision tree classifier to predict music genres based on user data. This project was created to build my understanding of supervised learning and how decision trees make decisions from structured data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Project Details
The model is trained using features such as age and gender, with the target variable being music genre. The decision tree learns a set of if/else rules that split the data to make predictions. A visualisation of the trained tree is included to help interpret how decisions are made.

## What I Learned
- How supervised machine learning works
- How to preprocess and split data for training
- How decision trees choose splits to reduce uncertainty
- How to visualise and interpret a trained model

## Notes
This project was created as part of my learning process. Some files reflect experimentation and iteration while following tutorials and testing different approaches.
